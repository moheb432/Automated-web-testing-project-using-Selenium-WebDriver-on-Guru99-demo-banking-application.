# Data-Driven Test Execution

* CSV / Scenario Outline used for multi-scenario testing  
* 30+ iterations executed  

Observed issues:  

1. Validation messages sometimes inconsistent  
2. UI responsiveness slower than expected for certain forms  
3. Certain fields allow invalid input (numbers, special characters)
